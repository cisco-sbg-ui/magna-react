<Props of="AAlert" />

## Accessibility Notes

By default, `AAlert` components are assigned the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/) role of [alert](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#alert) which denotes that the alert "is a live region with important and usually time-sensitive, information."

The `AAlert` `close` event handler is triggered both by the `click` event and by the `keyDown` event for both the `Enter` and `Space` keys.

The `AAlert` component as well as the close icon are tab-focusable with a visual overlay.
