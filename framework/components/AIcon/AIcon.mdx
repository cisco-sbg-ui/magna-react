# Icons

## Install

Integrate with your build to [auto-import](/#integrating), or add an import in your component:

```
import {AIcon} from "@cisco-sbg-ui/magna-react";
```

## Usage

<Playground
  code={`<>
  <AIcon>warning</AIcon>
  <AIcon size={32}>
    bell
  </AIcon>
  <AIcon size="large">plus</AIcon>
</>
`}
/>

## Props

The `AIcon` component inherits passed props.

<Props of="AIcon" />

## Gallery

<MagnaIconGallery />

## Legacy Atomic Gallery

<AtomicIconGallery />

## General Notes

Any icons not in the Gallery that were previously available in Atomic will still be used if references. They have been removed from the Gallery since there is no direct replacement with the Phosphor icon set.

## Accessibility Notes

By default, `AIcon` components use the [aria-label](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-label) attribute to label the icon by name. This can be overridden by setting the `label` prop on the component.
