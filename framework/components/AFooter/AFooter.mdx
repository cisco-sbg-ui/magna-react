By default, `AFooter` is assigned the [TR](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/) tag of [footer](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/sections.html#elementdef-footer) which denotes that it represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents, copyright data, and the like.
