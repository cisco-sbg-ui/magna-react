# Getting Started

## Install

The package is available publicly on GitHub Packages. `npm login` with the scope `@cisco-sbg-ui`. ([Read more here.](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry))

`npm i @cisco-sbg-ui/magna-react`

<br />

### Content Security Policy

If your website has a content security policy, in order for the fonts to load an entry will need to be added:

`font-src https://brand-assets.security.cisco.com`

<br />

## Sass Required

The components import sass modules. The dart-sass (`sass` package) must be installed and integrated into your bundler. Recommended to use `sass@1.43.3` or greater.

```
npm install --save-dev sass

yarn add sass --dev
```

<br />

### Optional Babel Preset and ESLint Config

The Babel preset **automatically imports** components. Add the following to your Babel configuration:

```diff
{
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    "@babel/preset-react",
+    "@cisco-sbg-ui/magna-react/babel-preset"
  ]
}
```

Without import statements, ESLint will complain about your source code. The magna-react ESLint plugin will take care of that. First install the ESLint plugin:

`npm i -D @cisco-sbg-ui/eslint-config-atomic-react`

Then add the following to your ESLint configuration:

```diff
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:react/recommended",
+    "@cisco-sbg-ui/eslint-config-atomic-react"
  ],
  ...
}
```

To use the babel preset and eslint config with `create-react-app`, use `craco`.

For usage with `next`, use `next-transpile-modules`
